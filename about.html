                            I was born in Washington, DC, and have had an interest in STEM fields and social sciences 
                            from a young age. I studied psychology and computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. 
                            I spent much of my time there conducting my own psychological research on emotion regulation and interpersonal
                            attachment dynamics. Following graduation, I moved to New York and served as a clinical 
                            research coordinator for suicide prevention at a VA hospital. Although clinical psychology 
                            will always be a passion of mine, I am taking a huge leap and pursuing my other passion as a career - 
                            coding! In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, flipping furniture, and discovering 
                            new recipes (despite being a mediocre chef).  I love the problem-solving and creativity involved in coding, and 
                            am thrilled to be a part of the Flatiron School community for this next step in my journey.
