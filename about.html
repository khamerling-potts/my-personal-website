                                I was born in Washington, DC, and have had an interest in STEM fields and social
                                sciences
                                from a young age. I studied psychology and computer science at Washington University in
                                St. Louis, where I was
                                exposed to multiple coding languages, frameworks, and projects. I spent much of my time
                                there conducting my own
                                psychological research on emotion regulation and interpersonal
                                attachment dynamics. Following graduation, I moved to New York and served as a clinical
                                research coordinator for suicide prevention at a VA hospital. Although I will always
                                have an interest
                                clinical psychology, I am transitioning to software engineering to pursue
                                programming as another passion of mine.
                                I love the problem-solving and creativity involved in coding and am excited to continue
                                learning full stack
                                development at Flatiron School. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, flipping
                                furniture, and discovering
                                new recipes. As I develop my portfolio, I will continue to add new projects to my
                                website.
